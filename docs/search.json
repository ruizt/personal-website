    "text": "High-dimensional time series — serial observations of a large number of measurements — are often modeled using an autoregressive framework for representing serial dependence within and between series. The model parametrization for this approach is dense, requiring a minimum of \\(p^2\\) parameters for a \\(p\\)-variate time series. Many of these parameters are negligibly small or contribute minimally to model fit; yet filtering out those parameters at the model fitting stage and selecting a reduced model is a challenge in practice with finite samples.\nI have a series of works exploring empirical methods of selecting an appropriate parameter subset for vector autoregressive models using resampling techniques. Early methods adapted an approach from the ordinary regression setting more or less directly (T. Ruiz et al. 2020) and explored performance when computations on resamples are carried out in parallel on a distributed architecture (Balasubramanian et al. 2020). My dissertation research refined the methodology through empirical experiments and considered its application to models for count-valued data (T. D. Ruiz 2020). Based on these experiments, I proposed selecting parameters identified with a user-specified minimum frequency across several validation subsamples (T. D. Ruiz, Bhattacharyya, and Emerson 2023). This method has applications in estimating causal networks from time series data, such as ecological interaction networks, functional connectivity in the brain, or macroeconomic relationships.\n\n\n\nPoisson mixtures with autoregressive conditional means provide a convenient framework for modeling count-valued multivariate time series due to their close connection with generalized linear models. For these models, the canonical link yields a process with conditional means that are log-linear in past values. This allows for both positive and negative serial correlations, but can result in superexponentiation of the mean over time unless parameters are chosen carefully. However, the unconditional process moments are not analytically tractable, so identifying the exact subset of the parameter space on which the process is stable is a challenge.\nI developed a constraint on the positive serial correlation structure for the log-linear model that is sufficient to ensure bounded first and second process moments (T. D. Ruiz, Bhattacharyya, and Emerson 2022). This has implications for simulation as well as for understanding model limitations. Future work might relax the constraint, establish necessary and sufficient stability conditions for the log-linear model, or propose an alternative parametrization that allows both positive and negative serial correlations but avoids the superexponentiation problem."

    "text": "Applications\n\nAgricultural epidemiology\nAgricultural epidemics driven by aerially-dispersed pathogens exhibit spatially anisotropic patterns of expansion from epicenters due to varying windspeeds and landscape features. Covariates that potentially explain patterns of anisotropy are readily available from public data sources, and thus allow for several approaches to modeling disease spread to potentially aid in identifying effective management interventions.\nI developed a network approach for modeling regional dispersal: disease levels obtained from a census of growing locations along with time-averaged wind intensity along the directions between locations were used to forecast disease levels using nonlinear generalized regression models (Gent, Bhattacharyya, and Ruiz 2019). I also developed a framework for modeling continental-scale epidemics with multiple epicenters using time-of-first-occurrence data from a spatially sparse monitoring network of sentinel growing plots (Ojwang et al. 2021)."
