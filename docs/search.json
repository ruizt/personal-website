    "text": "2023-2024\n\nModeling baseline metabolic needs of pregnant rattlesnakes from high resolution time series of body temperatures\nCollaboration with Haley Moniz (Biological Sciences, Cal Poly)\nProject status: positions available through Frost summer research program; [apply] by March 1, 2024.\nSuggested preparation. Intermediate-level proficiency in R (STAT 331 or similar); regression analysis (STAT 334 or similar).\n\nAbstract\nThis project seeks to explore the effect of pregnancy on metabolism among rattlesnakes. Beaupre & Duvall (1998) measured oxygen consumption in male, non-pregnant female, and (early) pregnant female rattlesnakes and developed general equations for calculating resting metabolic rate given a snake’s body temperature and weight. This project will leverage high-resolution time series of body temperatures collected from pregnant and non-pregnant female rattlesnakes over a period of several months to estimate metabolic rate fluctuations over time using the above-mentioned framework, and develop exploratory and statistical analyses aimed at (1) identifying metabolic differences between pregnant and non-pregnant rattlesnakes and (2) understanding temporal shifts in metabolism associated with seasonal and lifecycle factors.\nThis research will be co-advised by biology and statistics faculty and will involve both biology and statistics students. Students can expect to gain experience in interdisciplinary collaboration; correspondingly, statistics students can expect to gain domain expertise and biology students can expect to gain statistical expertise. The project will culminate in a working manuscript for eventual submission to a peer-reviewed journal.\nKeywords: thermal ecology; time series analysis; regression analysis; mixed-effects models.\n\n\n\nPermutation inference for functional data\nProject status: positions available through Frost summer research program; [apply] by March 1, 2024.\nSuggested preparation: intermediate-level proficiency in R (STAT 331 or similar) and multivariate analysis (STAT 419 or similar).\n\nAbstract\nIn the functional data analysis (FDA) setting, responses are continuous functions rather than scalars/vectors. In practice, functional responses are measured at a discrete resolution and must first be estimated using smoothing approximation techniques prior to data analysis. In many studies, high-resolution functional measurements are obtained on relatively few observational/experimental units, with relatively more attention given to the functional sampling resolution than to replication, effectively prioritizing response approximation quality over statistical inference. This project will explore the use of permutation inference for functional data with small sample sizes. Methods will apply permutation alternatives to standard parametric multivariate statistical tests for two-sample inference and analysis of variance to functional principal components. While this idea has been proposed in prior literature, it is relatively under-explored, leaving room for original contributions. The project will investigate performance through simulation and demonstrate applications through data analyses.\nStudents will focus on how functional approximations impact statistical power and seek to develop application heuristics based on simulations. Students will leverage existing software packages for FDA in R to implement methods and carry out simulations and analyses, and can expect to gain expertise in functional data analysis, statistical computing, and methodological development.\nKeywords: hypothesis testing; multivariate analysis; functional data analysis; statistical computing and simulation.\n\n\n\nUsing environmental DNA to identify microbial taxa associated with marine mammal abundances\nCollaboration with Erin Satterthwaite (Sea Grant/CalCOFI/UCSD)\nProject status: currently active, with additional positions available through the Frost summer research program; [apply] by March 1, 2024.\nSuggested preparation: intermediate-level proficiency in R (STAT 331 or similar); regression analysis (STAT 334 or similar) and multivariate analysis (STAT 419 or similar) preferred but not required.\n\nAbstract\nThis project seeks to leverage genetic metabarcoding data collected from quarterly cruises in the California current to search for microbial ‘signatures’ of presence and abundance of large marine mammals, with an initial focus on common species of whales. The project will involve using compositional data analysis and dimension reduction techniques to formulate a model of mammal abundance utilizing a sparse subset of microbial taxa and other covariates. There is also potential for the development of novel methodology. It is anticipated that the work will produce one or more journal publications.\nThis is an ongoing project. Students working on this project during summer will focus specifically on the development, implementation, and benchmarking of a novel algorithm for supervised dimension reduction of compositional data adjusted for covariate effects, and can expect to gain expertise in statistical computing.\nKeywords: environmental genomics; metabarcoding; dimension reduction; latent regression; compositional data analysis."

We utilize 16S and 18S r-RNA sequencing data obtained from ocean water samples collected at multiple depths along transects in the CalCOFI sampling grid as part of the NOAA-CalCOFI Ocean Genomics (NCOG) project together with density estimates computed from visual sightings of common whale species along the same transects.
