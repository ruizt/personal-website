Project teams establish a group contract outlining basic agreements pertaining to the collaboration and agree on outputs to produce for the sponsor by the end of the project – typically software, documentation, and a presentation. The course sequence culminates with a public showcase of student work.\n\n\n[PSTAT100] Data science concepts and analysis\nSpring 2021, Winter 2022, Spring 2022, Spring 2023\nA hands-on introduction to data science intended for intermediate-level students from any discipline with some exposure to probability and basic computing skills, but few or no upper-division courses in statistics or computer science. The course introduces central concepts in statistics – such as sampling variation, uncertainty, and inference – in an applied setting together with techniques for data exploration and analysis. Applications emphasize end-to-end data analyses.\n\n\n[PSTAT131/231] Statistical machine learning\nWinter 2021, Spring 2021\nStatistical Machine Learning is used to discover patterns and relationships in large data sets. Topics include: data exploration, classification and regression tress, random forests, clustering and association rules, building predictive models focusing on model selection, and model comparison and performance evaluation. Emphasis is on concepts, methods and data analysis, and students are expected to complete a significant class project, individual or team based, using real-world data.\n\n\n[PSTAT126] Regression analysis\nSummer 2021, Fall 2021\nA first course in linear regression for statistics majors covering both theory and applications with a strong emphasis on statistical computing and visualization techniques in R using tidyverse programming. Tools for reproducible analysis are also introduced. The course covers the linear model in matrix form, parameter estimation and interpretation, residual diagnostics, statistical inference, case influence statistics and outlier detection, common data transformations, categorical variables and interaction terms, and model selection and prediction.\n\n\n[PSTAT120B] Probability and statistics\nFall 2020, Winter 2021, Summer 2021, Fall 2021\nDistribution of sample mean and sample variance; t, chi-squared and F distributions; summarizing data by statistics and graphs; estimation theory for single samples: sufficiency, efficiency, consistency, method of moments, maximum likelihood; hypothesis testing: likelihood ratio test; confidence intervals."

We utilize 16S and 18S r-RNA sequencing data obtained from ocean water samples collected at multiple depths along transects in the California current together with density estimates computed from visual sightings of common whale species along the same transects. We formulate a log-contrast-type model relating species density to relative abundances of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) after adjusting for seasonality and environmental conditions and develop a sparse estimation procedure to identify small subsets of ASVs associated with changes in species density.\n\n\nModeling baseline metabolic needs of pregnant rattlesnakes from high resolution time series of body temperatures\nCollaboration with Haley Moniz and Emily Taylor (Biological Sciences, Cal Poly)\nStudent contributors (alphabetical order): Emma Reardon (biology); Nicole Yee (statistics)\nThis project seeks to explore the effect of pregnancy on metabolism among rattlesnakes. Beaupre & Duvall (1998) measured oxygen consumption in male, non-pregnant female, and (early) pregnant female rattlesnakes and developed general equations for calculating resting metabolic rate given a snake’s body temperature and weight. This project will leverage high-resolution time series of body temperatures collected from pregnant and non-pregnant female rattlesnakes over a period of several months to estimate metabolic rate fluctuations over time using the above-mentioned framework, and develop exploratory and statistical analyses aimed at (1) identifying metabolic differences between pregnant and non-pregnant rattlesnakes and (2) understanding temporal shifts in metabolism associated with seasonal and lifecycle factors.\n\n\nStatistical methods for environmental genomics\nSupported by the Research, Scholarly & Creative Activities Program awarded by the Cal Poly Division of Research\nStudent contributors: Nick Patrick.\nMany ecological studies collect physical samples of water, soil, or other media in order to extract and sequence environmental DNA (eDNA) for a variety of purposes (Ruppert et al. 2019); often these samples are co-located space and time with additional survey measurements (e.g., James et al. 2022). Integrating such data provides a potential means of investigating relationships between eDNA composition and ecological and environmental features across space and time, and although there are a variety of statistical methods that capture relationships between compositional (i.e., genomic) and non-compositional (i.e., environmental/physical/biological) variables, few facilitate adjustment of inferred relationships for covariates or dependence among observations due to spatial and temporal sampling patterns, both of which are present among ecological data. This project aims to: (1) develop a partial least squares (PLS) framework that explicitly incorporates these adjustments; (2) create, implement, and validate estimation algorithms; and (3) apply the methodology to one or more case studies."
