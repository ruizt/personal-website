    "text": "Current projects\n\nUsing environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to identify microbial correlates of marine mammal abundance\nCollaboration with Erin Satterthwaite and others (Scripps Institute of Oceanography, UCSD)\nStudent collaborators (alphabetical order): Katherine Chan (MS Statistics); Gabrielle Low (BS Statistics); Nick Patrick (BS Statistics); Samantha Ward (BS Statistics)\nThis project seeks to identify microbes predictive of the presence and abundance of large marine mammals in the California current. The project utilizes 16S and 18S r-RNA metabarcoding of eDNA obtained from ocean water samples collected at multiple depths along transects in the California current, together with density estimates computed from visual sightings of common whale species recorded along those same transects. We formulate a seasonally-adjusted log-contrast-type model relating density estimates to the relative abundances of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and implement a sparse estimation procedure to identify small subsets of ASVs predictive of whale density from 2014-2020.\n\n\nModeling baseline metabolic needs of pregnant rattlesnakes from high resolution time series of body temperatures\nCollaboration with Haley Moniz and Emily Taylor (Biological Sciences, Cal Poly)\nStudent collaborators (alphabetical order): Emma Reardon (BS Environmental Management & Protection); Nicole Yee (BS Statistics)\nThis project seeks to explore the effect of pregnancy on metabolism among rattlesnakes. Beaupre & Duvall (1998) measured oxygen consumption in male, non-pregnant female, and (early) pregnant female rattlesnakes and developed general equations for calculating resting metabolic rate given a snake’s body temperature and weight. This project will leverage high-resolution time series of body temperatures collected from pregnant and non-pregnant female rattlesnakes over a period of several months to estimate metabolic rate fluctuations over time using the above-mentioned framework, and develop exploratory and statistical analyses aimed at (1) identifying metabolic differences between pregnant and non-pregnant rattlesnakes and (2) understanding temporal shifts in metabolism associated with seasonal and lifecycle factors.\n\n\nCovariate adjustment in sparse partial least squares models for high-dimensional compositional data\nSupported by the Research, Scholarly & Creative Activities Program awarded by the Cal Poly Division of Research\nMany ecological studies collect physical samples of water, soil, or other media in order to extract and sequence environmental DNA (eDNA), and often these samples are co-located space and time with additional survey measurements. Integrating such data provides a potential means of investigating relationships between eDNA composition and ecological and environmental features across space and time, and although there are a variety of statistical methods that capture relationships between compositional (i.e., genomic) and non-compositional (i.e., environmental/physical/biological) variables, few facilitate adjustment of inferred relationships for covariates or dependence among observations due to spatial and temporal sampling patterns, both of which are present among ecological data. This project aims to develop a partial least squares (PLS) framework that explicitly incorporates these adjustments."
