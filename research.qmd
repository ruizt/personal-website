I'm interested broadly in models and methods for correlated and high-dimensional data with applications in life sciences. I also enjoy data analysis projects, especially those with spatial and temporal aspects. My graduate research focused on model selection and inference of causal networks in the context of multiple time series analysis. I'm currently exploring methods for the analysis of genetic metabarcoding data from ecological surveys, and developing several new research directions and collaborative projects with opportunities for student contributions.

## High-dimensional time series

High-dimensional time series --- serial observations of a large number of measurements --- are often modeled using an autoregressive framework for representing serial dependence within and between series. The model parametrization for this approach is dense, requiring a minimum of $p^2$ parameters for a $p$-variate time series. Many of these parameters are negligibly small or contribute minimally to model fit. Filtering out those parameters at the model fitting stage and selecting a reduced model is a challenge in practice with finite samples. My work in this area focuses on the use of resampling and stability methods with regularization for model selection, especially in the context of models for count data; applications include estimating ecological interaction networks and neural functional connectivity.

## Agricultural epidemiology

Agricultural epidemics driven by aerially-dispersed pathogens exhibit spatially anisotropic patterns of expansion from epicenters due to varying windspeeds and landscape features. Covariates that potentially explain patterns of anisotropy are readily available from public data sources, and thus allow for several approaches to modeling disease spread to potentially aid in identifying effective management interventions.

## Student capstone projects

I co/led instruction of a year-long capstone in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 with the goal of engaging undergraduate students in collaborative research. In the two years I oversaw the course we supported 28 projects spanning a wide range of domain and industry applications. I had the good fortune of working with many talented students and dedicated partnering labs and companies, several of whom extended their research efforts in various ways beyond the scope of the class.
