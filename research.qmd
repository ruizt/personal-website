I'm interested in statistical methods for correlated and high-dimensional data with applications in life sciences. I also enjoy data analysis and collaborative research projects involving applied statistical modeling.

I'm eager to include student contributors in my research and aim to work on topics/projects with aspects that I think would be accessible to students. For this reason, my current projects are collaborative and focus on specific applications or data analyses that would be accessible to undergraduate students but also have interesting methodological aspects and therein some potential to expand into methods projects suitable for graduate-level research.

## Current projects

#### Using environmental DNA to identify microbial taxa associated with marine mammal abundances

*Collaboration with Erin Satterthwaite (Sea Grant/CalCOFI/UCSD)*

*Student contributors (alphabetical order): Katherine Chan; Gabrielle Low; Nicholas Patrick; Samantha Ward*

This project leverages environmental metabarcoding data collected from quarterly cruises in the California current to identify microbial and microorganism 'signatures' of presence and abundance of large marine mammals. We utilize 16S and 18S r-RNA sequencing data obtained from ocean water samples collected at multiple depths along transects in the [CalCOFI sampling grid](https://calcofi.org/sampling-info/station-positions/) as part of the NOAA-CalCOFI Ocean Genomics (NCOG) project together with density estimates computed from visual sightings of common whale species along the same transects. We formulate a log-contrast-type model relating species density to relative abundances of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) after adjusting for seasonality and environmental conditions and develop a sparse estimation procedure to identify small subsets of ASVs associated with changes in species density.

#### Modeling baseline metabolic needs of pregnant rattlesnakes from high resolution time series of body temperatures

*Collaboration with Haley Moniz (Biological Sciences, Cal Poly)*

This project seeks to explore the effect of pregnancy on metabolism among rattlesnakes. Beaupre & Duvall (1998) measured oxygen consumption in male, non-pregnant female, and (early) pregnant female rattlesnakes and developed general equations for calculating resting metabolic rate given a snake's body temperature and weight. This project will leverage high-resolution time series of body temperatures collected from pregnant and non-pregnant female rattlesnakes over a period of several months to estimate metabolic rate fluctuations over time using the above-mentioned framework, and develop exploratory and statistical analyses aimed at (1) identifying metabolic differences between pregnant and non-pregnant rattlesnakes and (2) understanding temporal shifts in metabolism associated with seasonal and lifecycle factors.

## Student research

If you're interested in working with me, please get in touch. I often (though not always) have opportunities associated with current projects, as well as ideas for M.S. theses and independent study under STAT400/STAT500.

### Project ideas

#### Permutation inference for functional data

In the functional data analysis setting, responses are continuous functions rather than scalars/vectors. In practice, functional responses are measured at a discrete resolution and must first be estimated using smoothing approximation techniques prior to data analysis. In many studies, high-resolution functional measurements are obtained on relatively few observational/experimental units, with relatively more attention given to the functional sampling resolution than to replication, effectively prioritizing response approximation quality over statistical inference. This project would explore the use of permutation inference for functional data with small sample sizes. Methods would apply permutation alternatives to standard parametric multivariate statistical tests for two-sample inference and analysis of variance to the coefficients of functional principal components. While this idea has been proposed in prior literature, it is relatively under-explored, leaving room for original contributions. The project would investigate, in particular, the impact of functional approximations on statistical power.
