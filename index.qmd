Assistant Professor \| 2023-present

**University of California, Santa Barbara**

Visiting Assistant Professor \| 2020-2023

## Education

**Oregon State University** 

Ph.D. & M.S. Statistics \| 2015-2020

**Reed College** 

B.A. Philosophy \| 2007-2011

:::

I work primarily on statistical methods for the analysis of correlated and high-dimensional data in biology and ecology, and I especially enjoy collaborative applied projects in this area.

I'm eager to work with student collaborators and most of my agenda is designed with this in mind. If you're interested in working with me, or would like to chat about what that might entail, please get in touch.

The rest of this page represents my most recent work (last 2-3 years) and I typically update it quarterly.

## Current projects

#### Covariate adjustment and dependent error models in sparse partial least squares for high-dimensional compositional data

*Supported by the Research, Scholarly & Creative Activities Program awarded by the Cal Poly Division of Research*

Increasingly, ecological surveys encompass sampling and metabarcoding of environmental DNA from water, soil, and other media. Such data can capture rich networks of ecological relationships and, when combined with traditional survey measurements, can be used to explore relationships between ecological communities. However, many if not most statistical approaches to the analysis of metabarcoding data were originally developed in the context of microbiome studies, in which there is substantially less environmental and spatiotemporal variation across samples. As such, few current methods incorporate covariate adjustments for environmental features or error models accounting for dependence between observations across space and time. This project aims to develop such adjustments in the context of partial least squares -- a common modeling framework for high-dimensional compositional data -- and illustrate their application to ecological data.
